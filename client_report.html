        <h2>Client Report</h2>
        <p><u>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</u><br>
        I started by comparing color palette samples and looking at examples of how websites would look with different colors and fonts. Then I picked images that matched the vibe I wanted. Since my site is about cooking, I just looked up easy, cheap recipes for college students.</p>

        <p><u>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?</u><br>
        I talked to my developer on the first day, we exchanged contact info, and I sent him my site plan. He later sent me the final result, which I was happy with overall, even though one child page was missing because a junior developer couldn’t be reached.</p>

        <p><u>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</u><br>
        Yes, the lead developer met my expectations. It was just a little disappointing that one child page was missing due to the unreachable junior developer.</p>

        <p><u>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</u><br>
        Next time, I’ll check in more often and communicate better with my team to make sure everything gets done.</p>

        <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>

        <p><u>How did you manage your development team and communicate the tasks for your junior devs?</u><br>
        I emailed both junior developers and also talked to them during class. One of them was unreachable, but we were able to do their part ourselves.</p>

        <p><u>How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?</u><br>
        We first talked in person and exchanged contacts. He sent his site plan late and it was a little vague. So I asked him for more info, but didn’t follow up enough. Eventually, he sent what we needed and I could finish my part and manage my Jr developers.</p>

        <p><u>How did you handle publishing your client’s site and sharing it with the client?</u><br>
        Publishing went great. I sent the link to my client, although a bit late due to the delays. And I asked for feedback, but didn’t get a response.</p>

        <p><u>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?</u><br>
        It was confusing at first, but I eventually understood how to use it to a certain extent.</p>

        <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>

        <p><u>How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?</u><br>
        In one team, instructions were clear on GitHub, so I didn’t need to ask much. In the other, I had questions, so I contacted my lead in class and he helped me.</p>

        <p><u>Did you know what was expected of you for each site?</u><br>
        For one of my teams it was clear from the start as it was written in the GitHub page description, and I asked for help in the other because it wasn't very clear, but then I understood what I needed to do.</p>

        <p><u>Were you able to contribute to your sites?</u><br>
        Yes, I completed my child pages for both teams.</p>

        <p><u>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?</u><br>
        Only once, when my changes weren’t publishing, but I figured out how to fix it.</p>

        <p><u>Links to the sites:</u><br>

        <h2>General Experience Report</h2>

        <p><u>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?</u><br>
        The hardest part was communication, especially with my client. The site plan was a little vague, so I had to figure out a lot on my own. I overcame it by asking for more details and using examples.</p>

        <p><u>What did you enjoy most about this project?</u><br>
        I enjoyed creating my site plan and seeing the finished websites. It was fun picking the color palette, fonts, and images.</p>

        <p><u>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?</u><br>
        I’d try to connect more with my team and make everyone feel more comfortable communicating. I’d also ask more questions when needed.</p>

        <p><u>Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.</u><br>
        I would say now I definitely feel more confident because now I know how to handle roles, use GitHub, and work through issues as a team.</p>
